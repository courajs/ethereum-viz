# Ethereum Viz

Experiments in creating a scriptable ethereum vizualization framework,
for creating explanatory animations.

I think this could give learners new to Ethereum a much better intuitive
understanding of how it works. Also, visual explanations of common
contract vulnerabilities could improve the security of the whole
ecosystem

Having this tool would allow great communication by people advertising
utility contracts, such as the ethereum alarm clock or computation
market, or by people proposing new patterns or strategies to the
community.


# Planned animations
- How the network verifies blocks, and how invalid or forged blocks get
  rejected.
- How a re-entrancy bugs get exploited, and how
  Checks-Effects-Interactions helps you avoid them
- Why a transaction confirmed in a single block might eventually be
  rolled back.
- Examples of surprising out-of-gas exceptions, due to other
  transactions in the block.
- How the alarm clock market works
- Visual stepper & debugger for contracts?
